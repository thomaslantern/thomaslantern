### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name's Thomas, and I like to code. I love programming, computers, and learning about both.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
  - Contributing to analyzing AI responses for DataAnnotation
  - Gradually improving some of my school projects for general purpose use, such as:
    - A music maker for NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) that lets you customize a song and then it builds you a NES cartridge file (.NES) you can download and listen to! (https://www.github.com/thomaslantern/nesmusicmaker)
    - Writing (or editing) my documentation for the tutorials I made for how to learn ASM6502/NES programming, available here:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... so many things! Here's a few:
  - Going to **Athabasca University (part-time, honours student)**. I've loved every course so far. It's been a great experience!
  - Reading through **_The Art of Computer Programming_ Vol I, by Donald Knuth** (and apparently learning the MIX assembly language); **(page 110/463)**
  - Reading through **_The Art of Computer Programming_ Vol II, by Donald Knuth**; **(page 302/515)**
  - Reading through **_The Art of Computer Programming_ Vol III, by Donald Knuth**; **(page 54/570)**
  - Reading through **_Algorithms_, by Robert Sedgewick** (and apparently learning a bit of Pascal!); **(page 362/536)**

**Finished Reading:**
  - **_Effective Java Programming Language Guide_, by Joshua Bloch**; **(Feb 2025)**
  - **_JavaScript Pocket Reference_, by David Flanagan**; **(Jan 2025)**
  - **_The Practice of Programming_, by Kernighan and Pike**; **(Dec 2024)**
  - **_The C Programming Language (2nd Edition)_, by Kernigan and Ritchie**; **(Oct 2023)**
  

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send me an email! **shikisha at hotmail dot com** is my main e-mail address. I'd love to speak with you about all things code.
